Abstract
The stability of any system in the power grid is very important, and the concern is due to the high 
demand and supply of smart cities, homes, factories, and so on. The stability appears in: 
1- Provide sufficient capacity for voltage stability at every portion of the grid.
2- Smart grid also motivates the use of renewable energy resources rather than nonrenewable 
ones [4].
3- Generation has to match the demand at any time for immediate outages.
4- Smart grids can be used to enhance the smooth functioning of every domain like electricity 
generation either from renewable or nonrenewable energy resources [3].
Which is by dynamically estimating grid stability becomes not only a concern but a major 
requirement. Decentral Smart Grid Control (DSGC) systems monitor one particular property of 
the grid—its frequency. The user can change the consumption by the perception of the price of 
the consumption.so the DSGC is mainly collecting the data such as consumer demand.
After collect consumption data the information will sent to center to evaluate against current 
supply conditions, after that the system will predict the price information then sent back to 
consumers to change their usage depending on the cost. Finally the DSGC depend on time to 
keep grid stable.
So to deal with the stability prediction problem in the smart energy grids that will be by using 
different prediction models in artificial intelligence (AI) in Different machine learning (ML) and 
deep learning (DL).
The accuracy will show how the model learns well, by using metrics accuracy measures.
This project will use the deep learning predictive model ANN optimized with Adam optimizer 
provides better results than other predictive models.
Finally, provide the network administrator with all required information about the current 
network power balance, so that it can price its energy offering—and inform consumers—
accordingly.
